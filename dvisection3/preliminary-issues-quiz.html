                <h2>Question 1</h2>
                If service on the respondent has not been accomplished, is the best practice to continue to 
              extend temporary injunctions (provided that the petitioner wishes to proceed with the injunction) 
              until such time as the respondent can be properly served?

                Actually, given the importance of providing permanent or long-term protection to families affected by domestic violence, you should be 
                alerted to instances of multiple extensions of temporary injunctions for time periods extending beyond 30 days. Temporary injunctions do not automatically 
                require the surrender of firearms and cannot be entered into the statewide injunction database. 
                A final injunction is the appropriate mechanism for providing long term protection, 
                if the petitioner wishes to proceed, and the judge believes that all reasonable efforts have been made to serve notice on the respondent.

              This is correct. A pro se litigant can file a petition for protection against domestic violence. §741.30(1)(f), Florida Statutes. 
              Also, "[a]ny person described in paragraph (e) who is either the victim of domestic violence as defined in §741.28, Florida Statutes, 
              or has reasonable cause to believe he or she is in imminent danger of becoming the victim of any act of domestic violence, has standing 
              in the circuit court to file a sworn petition for an injunction for protection against domestic violence." §741.30(1)(a), 
              Florida Statutes. Neither party is entitled to representation by an attorney or appointment of an attorney by the court.
          The court may enter a final injunction for protection against a party without appointing counsel for the respondent, 
          as Florida Rules of Criminal Procedure 3.830 and 3.840 do not apply to injunction hearings.

            This is correct. The best practice would be to allow the advocate to stand at the podium with the victim. 
            Some advocates stand between the petitioner and the respondent to help the petitioner feel safe. 
            In fact, §741.30(7), Florida Statutes, states that an advocate from a certified domestic violence center, 
            who is registered under §39.905, Florida Statutes, may be present with the petitioner or respondent during any court proceedings or 
            hearings related to the injunction for protection, provided the petitioner or respondent has made such a request and the advocate is able to be present. 
            A victim of domestic violence also enjoys the ability to have confidential communication with a domestic violence advocate regarding the
            domestic violence incident pursuant to §90.5036, Florida Statutes.
