			  This is correct. When issuing a final injunction, it is mandatory that you use the Florida Supreme Court approved domestic violence form. 
			The following provisions are standard and mandatory in Florida Injunctions for Protection Against Domestic Violence: 
			</div>
			<ul>
				<li>The court had jurisdiction over the parties and matter. Section 741.30(6)(d)(3), Florida Statutes.</li>
				<li>Reasonable notice and opportunity to be heard was given to respondent sufficient to protect that person's rights to due process. Section 741.30(6)(d)(3), Florida Statutes.</li>
				<li>The date the respondent was served with the temporary or final order, if obtainable. Section 741.30(6)(d)(4), Florida Statutes.</li>
				<li>Restraining the respondent from committing any acts of domestic violence against petitioner or any member of petitioner's family or household members. Section 741.30(6)(c), Florida Statutes.</li>
				<li>Restraining respondent from contact with petitioner or any member of petitioner's immediate family or household. Florida Supreme Court Approved Family Law Form 12.980(d)(1-2).</li>
				<li>Referring a petitioner to a certified domestic violence center. If the court refers the petitioner to a certified domestic violence center, the court must provide the petitioner with a list of certified domestic violence centers in the circuit, which the petitioner may contact. Section 741.30(6)(a)(6), Florida Statutes.</li>
				<li>Ordering respondent to surrender any firearms and ammunition in his/her possession to the specified sheriff's office pending further order of the court. Florida Supreme Court Approved Family Law Form 12.980(d)(1-2).</li>
			</ul>
			<ol>
			<li>Firearms Violation: It is a violation of §790.233, Florida Statutes, and a first degree misdemeanor for respondent to have in his or her care, custody, possession or control any firearm or ammunition. Section 741.30(6)(g), Florida Statutes.</li>
			<li>Section 741.31(4)(b)(1), Florida Statutes, states that possession of a firearm or ammunition is prohibited when a person is subject to a permanent injunction against committing acts of domestic violence. It is a first degree misdemeanor to violate the firearms provision of an injunction and punishable as provided in §775.083, Florida Statutes. However, this provision is consistent with federal law and therefore the active law enforcement exception applies in Florida. This provision does not apply to active law enforcement 
			officers who possess firearms and ammunition for use in performance of their job, unless the law enforcement agency finds that possession of firearms should be denied. Section 741.31(b)(2), Florida Statutes.</li>
			<li>Federal law also prohibits any person under a permanent domestic violence injunction from possessing a firearm, under penalty of up to ten years of incarceration. 18 U.S.C. § 922(g)(8). 18 U.S.C. § 922(g)(9) also prohibits any person convicted of domestic violence from possessing a firearm with a similar penalty.</li>
			<li>A trial court has no power to authorize a respondent to possess firearms in violation of federal law. Weissenburger v. Iowa Dist. Court for Warren County, 740 N.W.2d 431(Iowa, 2007). </li>
			</ol>

			<ul>
			<li>Exclude respondent from places frequented regularly by petitioner and/or any named family or household member of petitioner. Florida Supreme Court Approved Family Law Forms 12.980(d)(1) and 12.980(d)(2).</li>
			<li>A statement which says the injunction is valid and enforceable in all counties in Florida. Section 741.30(6)(d)(1), Florida Statutes.</li>
			<li>Law enforcement officers may use their arrest powers pursuant to §901.15(6), Florida Statutes, to enforce the terms of the injunction. Section 741.30(6)(d)(2), Florida Statutes.</li>
			<li>Pursuant to the Violence Against Women Act, 18 U.S.C. §2265, all states must give full faith and credit to restraining orders and orders of protection against domestic violence that meet the federal definition if the respondent was given notice and an opportunity to be heard.</li>
			</ul>
