                          The untrue statement is that determination of time-sharing between parties is permanent. Pursuant to s. 741.30(6), 
                          time-sharing ordered between the parties in injunction hearings is temporary in nature; the time-sharing schedule remains in effect until the injunction expires or an order is entered in a pending or subsequent civil case or proceeding involving parental rights and responsibilities for the minor children.
