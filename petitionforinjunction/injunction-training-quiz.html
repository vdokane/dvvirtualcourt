              You answered Yes. This is correct. <br />
         The petitioner is married to, has children with, and lived with the respondent as a family; so pursuant to the domestic
          violence statute, she meets the criteria and has standing to file the petition. 
          The court could reasonably issue a temporary injunction because there appears to be an appearance or reasonable fear of imminent and present danger as required. Section 741.30(5)(a), Florida Statutes, states that when a petitioner files a petition for injunction and “it appears to the court that an immediate and present danger of domestic violence exists,” the court may grant a temporary injunction ex parte.
In the petition, Anna alleged that she is in fear of physical violence from the respondent; that the respondent punched a 
hole in the wall right beside her, destroyed her phone, pictures, and the dish, which are her personal property; threatened her, 
restrained her from using the telephone to call for help, threatened to conceal the petitioner’s children, has a criminal history involving
violence; that she has had an order of protection from another jurisdiction against the respondent; 
and that the respondent has engaged in other behavior or conduct that leads the petitioner to have reasonable cause to believe 
that she is in imminent danger, including that he has called her repeatedly at all hours of the night.

          You answered Yes.
        Actually, while the judge can award the petitioner temporary exclusive use and occupancy of the dwelling that the parties share (Section 741.30(5)(a)(2), Florida Statutes) as well as temporary custody of a minor child or children of the parties (Section 741.30(5)(a)(3), Florida Statutes) ex parte, child support cannot be awarded until the final hearing.
      Find out whether paternity has ever been established and if the petitioner is already receiving child support in another case. Also ask whether the mother was legally married to a man who is not the other party in the current case when the child(ren) was conceived or born. If paternity has never been established, inform the petitioner that initiating a paternity case is one way to have child support established on a permanent basis.

        The court has three options when considering a petition:
        <ul>
            <li>Issue the temporary injunction which includes setting the matter for a final hearing;</li>
            <li>Deny the temporary injunction and provide written explanation for doing so;</li>
            <li>Enter an Order Setting Hearing Only.</li>

        While the Judge may not have found that the petition stated sufficient grounds for the issuance of a 
        temporary injunction, the Judge may still want to speak to the parties in person in order to better understand the allegations in the petition.
