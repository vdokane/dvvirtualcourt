                      This is correct.
                      It is a first degree misdemeanor to willfully violate an injunction for protection against domestic violence or foreign order that is given full faith and credit pursuant 
                      to §741.315, Florida Statutes. Pursuant to §741.31 (4)(a), Florida Statutes, actions which constitute a willful violation include: refusing to vacate 
                      the dwelling the parties share; going to or being within 500 feet of, the petitioner's residence, school, place of employment, or a specified place frequented by 
                      the petitioner and named family or household member; committing an act of domestic violence against the petitioner; committing any other violation of the 
                      injunction through an intentional unlawful threat, word, and act to do violence to the petitioner; telephoning, contacting, or otherwise communicating with the petitioner directly or indirectly, unless the injunction specifically allows indirect contact through a third party; knowingly or intentionally coming within 100 feet of the petitioner's motor vehicle, whether or not that vehicle is occupied; defacing or destroying the petitioner's personal property, including the petitioner's motor vehicle; or refusing to surrender firearms or ammunition if ordered to do so by the court. Under Florida Law, each violation subjects the offender to a maximum sentence of one year, and/or a $1,000.00 fine, in addition to possible civil penalties. Also, if the respondent followed or harassed the Petitioner, he/she may be arrested for aggravated stalking, a felony punishable by up to five years in prison. See §§775.082, 775.083 and 741.31(4)(a), Florida Statutes. 
                      Providing contact information for the State Attorney’s Office to the petitioner can be a way of increasing the number of injunction violations that get prosecuted.

                      The court may address a violation of an injunction for protection against domestic violence through a civil or criminal contempt proceeding, or the state attorney may prosecute it as a criminal violation. §741.30(9)(a), Florida Statutes. According to §741.2901(2), Florida Statutes, it is the intent of the legislature that domestic violence be treated as a crime; and for that reason, ''criminal prosecution shall be the favored method of enforcing compliance with injunctions for protection against domestic violence.'' However, that provision does not preclude the court from using indirect criminal contempt or a civil contempt proceeding to enforce the order. If the violation is punishable by criminal contempt and incarceration, criminal contempt can be used as a remedy. Criminal contempt proceedings are subject to Florida Rules of Criminal Procedure 3.830 and 3.840 and to the ''constitutional limitations applicable to criminal cases including due process requirement of a burden of proof 'beyond a reasonable doubt.''' Dowis v. State, 578 So.2d 860, 862 (Fla. 5th DCA 1991). See also Lapushinsky v. Campbell, 738 So. 2nd 514(Fla. 1st DCA 1999). In a criminal proceeding, the respondent is also entitled to counsel to ensure due process. See Gordon v. State, 960 So.2d 31(Fla. 4th DCA 2007).
                      </p>
                      <p>The court could also begin civil contempt proceedings rather than criminal. Civil contempt is a remedy of a court ''to coerce obedience to its orders which direct a civil litigant to do or abstain from doing an act or acts...'' Dowis v. State, 578 So.2d 860,862 (Fla. 5th DCA 1991). Violations of provisions such as child support and timesharing may be enforced through civil contempt sanctions, since the purpose of a civil contempt proceeding is to coerce compliance, not to impose punishment. The burden of proof for civil contempt proceedings is a preponderance of the evidence.
