                  This issue is discretionary. In many domestic violence cases, the respondent harasses the petitioner by stalking or even approaching the petitioner at her job or school which could cause the petitioner to lose her job or put the petitioner in danger. Therefore, it would be appropriate to exclude the respondent from these locations to ensure the safety and well-being of the petitioner if it seems needed based upon the particular facts of the case.

                  This answer is correct.
                  This provision would be appropriate in this case since the respondent has threatened to take the children. However, custody, now referred to as time-sharing, must be properly pled in the domestic violence petition to assure that the respondent's due process rights are not violated. Ryan v. Ryan, 784 So.2d 1215 (Fla. 2d DCA 2001); O'Neill v. Stone, 721 So.2d 393 (Fla. 2d DCA 1998). A Uniform Child Custody Jurisdiction and Enforcement Act Affidavit, Florida Supreme Court Approved Family Law Form 12.902(d), must also be filed by petitioner if seeking such relief. §741.30(3)(d), Florida Statutes. The temporary support, parenting plan and time-sharing provisions that are established in a permanent domestic violence injunction remain in effect until the order expires or when an order, which addresses support, the parenting plan and/or time-sharing, is entered in a pending or subsequent civil action. §741.30(6)(a)(3-4), Florida Statutes. The court should not award a parenting plan, child support, or timesharing rights to a man whose paternity has not been established.
                  <p>
                    Paternity may be established by a separate paternity action filed in family court; a hospital affidavit executed by both parents pursuant to §§382.013 or 382.016, Florida Statutes; an affidavit or stipulation of paternity executed by both parents and filed with the clerks of the court; in a worker's compensation or similar hearing determining who is the dependent of an injured worker; in an adjudicatory hearing in a probate case (addressing inheritance); or in a dependency proceeding under Chapter 39, Florida Statutes.

                  This answer is correct.
                  The court should order temporary support for both children, since Joe is the legal and biological father of John and Melissa. 
                  The court should use the income information attached to the petition and the pay stubs provided by the respondent in court to calculate the child 
                  support guidelines for child support for John. The petitioner may seek temporary child support from the respondent if the respondent is the legal parent, 
                  adoptive parent, or guardian by court order of a minor child or children. See §§ 741.30(6)(a)(4), 61.13(1)(a), 39.402(11)(a), Florida Statutes; Florida Supreme

                  The court should preferably order temporary support for both children, since Joe is the legal and biological father of John and Melissa.
