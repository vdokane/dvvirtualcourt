                      This is correct. The court can begin civil contempt proceedings. Civil contempt is a remedy of a court 'to coerce obedience to its orders which direct a
                       civil litigant to do or abstain from doing an act or acts ... ' Dowis v. State, 578 So.2d 860,862 (Fla. 5th DCA 1991). 
                       Since the respondent was present and served with a copy of the final injunction, which contained a provision that the respondent should enroll in a state-certified batterer intervention program (BIP) within 30 days and file proof of such with the clerk's office, and the judge is aware that the respondent failed to comply, it is correct to issue an Order to Show Cause. This Order to Show Cause must set a date for a hearing on the matter and must be served upon the respondent. If the respondent is served and fails to appear, then the judge may issue a warrant for arrest for failure to appear. The petitioner should be copied and may attend if he/she would like but attendance is not required. If the respondent does appear, then a hearing should be held to determine if the respondent is in civil contempt of court and if any further court action will be taken on the matter. It is important that a reliable system of communication between 
                      BIP providers and the court be in place so that the court can receive accurate and timely information on compliance.

The order must be also specific enough to enable staff to monitor respondent’s compliance with the order.
